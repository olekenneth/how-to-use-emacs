# How to use Emacs
Gathering of often used emacs commands

Shortcut | Explanation
--- | ---
`C-x` | this means hold **Control** and push **x**
`M-w` | this means hold **Meta** and push **w**

Meta is sent by the terminal and is setup differently from terminal to terminal. In cases where terminal doesn't send meta, you have to tap once at escape to send meta-command, so no need to hold it down. In e.g. iTerm2 you have to set option-key to send meta.
